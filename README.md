# Personal-Website

This is a way for me to use version control to monitor the progress of my website as I add new blog posts that track my progress in my software engineering practicum this semester. I also want to track any incremental changes to the design of my website. 

## Future ideas:
I may be adding a different blog to track my progress with learning Microsoft Azure. I started my free account yesterday. 

Add a portfolio link.
## Completed:
Added a link to GitHub.
