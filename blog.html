				<h5><strong>Blog Post Four:</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>What's Happening?</em></h3>
				
				<p>This week I was asked to read an article from the IEEE Software publication. IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The authors of "Trends and Challenges 
					for Software Engineering in the Mobil Domain," featured in the Mobile Computing section of the IEEE Software publication for January-February 2021, forecast the future of mobile 
					applications. This article is a summary “of a discussion that 65 researchers and practitioners had during a panel session, The Role of Engineering and Development in Mobile Software,
					 held at the 2018 IEEE/Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems conference in Gothenburg, Sweden”(89) They call 
					 for the academic embrace of new methodologies, frameworks, and work processes, which “are mandatory and require a direct link between research, industry, and end users”(88). While I would 
					 like to unpack each of these throughout the course of this post, I will only discuss a these with varying degrees of success.   
				</p>
				<p>The authors reveal an increase in research articles "relating to 'mobile’ or ‘Android’ has grown from 14% of all accepted papers in 2016 to 31% in 2018, a 120% increase during the 
					span of two years”(88). While this is significant, it isn’t necessarily surprising given that mobile devices currently account for 66% of time users spend consuming digital media. 
				</p>
				<p>This ubiquity implies that android developers must follow fast development cycles while balancing the tradeoffs that come with rapid development: energy efficiency, security, and 
					privacy. In fact, the authors propose that tradeoff analysis should be required “during the design and development of mobile apps”(89). Of course, tradeoff analysis is exactly 
					what it sounds like: analyzing the loss or gain from trading between a quality or aspect of design or development. In theory I would agree with this; however, it could be 
					problematic to add more to a workflow when trying to meet project deadlines. On the other hand, tradeoff analysis is already implicitly baked into design and development, so 
					asking those involved to explicitly perform tradeoff analysis might not be a stretch on team resources.  
				</p>
				<p>The authors also suggest stepping beyond Android to contribute in a more general way that won’t be made irrelevant in the case of a disruption to the mobile OS ecosystem. 
					I’m not sure that I buy that argument though. I contend that Android is here to stay, especially since it is open source. This isn’t to say that the authors don’t recommend 
					very real challenges for researchers. New distribution platforms created by researchers could disrupt the ecosystem and make entry that much easier for new projects. Expanding 
					IDEs and application programming interfaces are another suggestion. They even recommend moving beyond Java to explore languages that extend Java such as Kotlin, or a framework 
					such as React Native created by Facebook. 
				</p> 
				<p>Perhaps one of the most significant points made in this article is about the transition from research to industry. The authors warn that industry operates at scale, which requires 
					the minimizing of complexity. Often is the case that researchers solve problems without regard to complexity as long as the problem is adequately researched. This seems to be the 
					point of new frameworks, to minimize complexity by extending existing languages. The more we abstract away the complexity, perhaps the better equipped we are to solve real problems
					in the existing ecosystem of mobile computing.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Three:</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>This Bugs Me</em></h3>
				
				<p>Exercise 6.4 of the Teaching Open Source text requires that I find the oldest bug in Open Library’s issues tracker that hasn’t been resolved. Thankfully, Open Library 
					has a long history on GitHub, so locating this was merely an act of sorting issues by oldest to newest. The oldest bug was #29, which is titled, “’add-cover’ edits in 
					Recent Changes table should display Cover as comment (for review).” This bug was opened June 29, 2011, so this particular bug is nearly a decade old. 
				</p>
				<p>From what I can glean from the comments, it looks like the goal of this bug is to add a feature to the added covers section. Open Library has people and bots uploading images daily. 
					In fact, it looks like hundreds of images are added daily. Clearly quality control becomes an issue when uploading images in such volume. The user interface lacks the ability to 
					quickly see the image quality of cover pages without clicking on each one.  In other words, librarians and those adding images would like the ability to preview the images without 
					having to click a link to the book. 
				</p>
				<p>It isn’t clear why this hasn’t been resolved yet. In fact, it’s not for a lack of engagement from the community or leads at Open Library. Just twelve days ago, Mek renamed a label 
					from Team: Front-end to frontend, which I assume is replacing deprecated language. The following day, tushar-ga requested to work on this issue. I think one way to solve this issue 
					would be to create a separate page as a gallery of images, but that’s just my initial thought. There’s probably a more elegant and less costly approach that would involve reworking 
					the existing interface. 
				</p>
				<p>Exercise 6.5 requires that I create a bug tracker account. Fortunately, Open Library uses GitHub to track there bugs and Slack to resolve issues and blockages. We were invited to the 
					Slack this week, and we were assigned to our first issue on Monday, February 01.</p> 
				<p>Exercise 6.6.1 requires that a bug be reproduced; however, we are still trying to understand the architecture and workflow. I found a recent issue with intermittent inability to 
					upload images. Our team still hasn’t been able to upload locally, so this is something that needs to wait. One example of a reproducible bug is something that I already mentioned: 
					issue #29. I don’t want to comment on a separate bug right now because we have already been assigned to an issue, which is labeled good first issue. I will post an update here once 
					I am able to upload images to reproduce our current issue #4492.</p>

				<p>Exercise 6.7.1 requires that I find five bug reports—in the case of Open Library these are issues—and to triage them according to triage rules. One such rule is to look for similar
					 bugs. I noticed that bug #29 had a similar bug, which was closed because it was basically the same thing: issue #108. I located an issue categorized as Epic, which means that it 
					 is a long-term project. This epic is for HTML validation and has seven related issues: #3881, #4438, #4439, #4440, #4441, #4472, and #4473. All have been closed except for #4438. 
					 #4438 looks to have been resolved, so I commented on the Epic to notify the lead that it can be closed and all checkboxes for the issues in this epic can be checked off. </p>
					 <h4>Update:</h4>
					 <p>This morning my team and I discovered how to upload images to replicate the issue of stretched covers in the carousele. The main problem was that we needed to open separate
						 terminals to execute the commands. I am going to upload a video tutorial that walks contributors through the process of importing test data so that others can see how to add books 
						 and editions locally.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Two: </strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Reflections on Open Source in Today's World</em></h3>

				
				<p>I chose two articles to read from <a href="https://www.opensource.com">opensource.com</a> on containerization because our project, Open Library, uses Docker as the development environment.
				   While I have used Docker at a Hackathon and in a data management course, I have not used it in a large-scale development environment like the one for Open Library. I also know that Docker
				   has a large user base among the open-source community.   
				</p>
				<p>In the first <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker">article</a> titled, “What is Docker?,” the author considers the definition of Docker, its use cases, how to set it 
					up on your machine, security features, and the big picture of containerization. First, Docker is a way to virtualize without having to create a virtual machine. In other words,
					Docker can use an existing Linux kernel on the host system to run the containers. Well, how does this work on Windows? Fortunately, WSL 2 provides a solution for Windows users. 
					VS Code even recognizes that I’m using WSL 2 to run a lightweight utility virtual machine on the Linux OS. I suppose there is a virtual machine in my case, but it isn’t the same 
					as running virtual box, which runs with more layers away from root. 
				</p>
				<p>Second, Docker is mostly used for DevOps teams to keep developers focused on writing code instead of thinking about the intricacies of compatibility issues. Third, setting up 
					Docker really couldn’t be easier now. It was once the case that Windows users needed Windows Professional, but as previously discussed, WSL 2 provides a solution to this. 
					Now Mac and Windows users are basically on a level playing field. Fourth, Docker containers “do not contain.” In Daniel Walsh’s article titled, “Are Docker containers really 
					secure?” he writes, “[f]rom a security point of view, containers are much weaker.” I am certainly not a security expert yet, but Walsh attributes this vulnerability to running 
					the services close to root instead of non-root. Lastly, containers can be placed into three separate software categories: Builder, Engine, and Orchestration. The builder is 
					the tech used to build the container. The engine is the tech to run a container, and Orchestration is the tech to manage containers.  
				</p>
				<p>Lacey Williams, who is also an English major turned tech geek, gave a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/12/python-and-containers-conference-talks">talk</a> at djangocon.us 
					in 2018 called “An Intro to Docker for Djangonauts” that unpacks the basic language surrounding Docker through the lens of Harry Potter, specifically the concept of Polyjuice 
					potion, which is a potion used to turn into someone else when the hair of that other person is put in the potion and then consumed. In this metaphor, Docker is the potion, the 
					image is the person you want to turn into, the container is you, the Dockerfile is the hair of the person you want to turn into. In the world of Harry Potter, the hair tells 
					the potion how to change into someone else, and the potion is consumed to transform into that person. 
				</p> 
				<p>Meanwhile, in the world of containerization, we use the Dockerfile to tell Docker how to build the image. We then run the project in a container. Some code that is essential to 
					every Docker container is $ docker build. Before you can build, there must be a Dockerfile. It seems that most projects that have already been established already have a Dockerfile
					 as part of the repository, which means that creating a Dockerfile is one of those steps that an open-source contributor rarely needs to do. Interestingly, each time the Dockerfile 
					 is built, it will rely on a previously cached version unless changes have been made to the Dockerfile. In that case, the cached version is loaded, then the changes and everything 
					 after the changes are built. 
				</p>
				<p>It turns out that there are a lot of things to type when using regular Docker. In other words, it can become a bit syntactically verbose, as alluded to in the previous paragraph. 
				   Thankfully, Docker has a workaround called Docker compose. Docker compose allows for naming conventions to be explicit in a docker-compose.yml file. Here you can name the 
				   containers, volume, ports for mapping locally, and dependencies such as a database that the web service container might depend on. While it is not recommended to host your 
				   database from a container because databases are stateful, not stateless, using an old version of a database in a container for production reasons is an option. In fact, Alice 
				   Goldfuss’ <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/12/python-and-containers-conference-talks">talk</a> titled, “The Container Operator’s Manual,” she recommends that all databases be located on the cloud. 
				</p>
				<p>These articles are a good starting place for continuing my education with Open Source. My next steps with Open Library are going to be to understand the architecture and way to 
				   communicate with the database locally. In this way I will be better equiped to solve code challenges as opposed to developing within a challenging environment.

			<h3><em>Reflections of FOSS:</em></h3>
            
			<p>Since my last post, I was assigned to my team: Quad Squad. We generated a <a href="https://github.com/CSCI-462-01-2021/Quad-Squad/wiki/Top-Three-Choices">list</a> 
				of three free-open-source software (foss) candidates that we will begin building locally on our machines to determine our project for the semester.
				 We picked <a href="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates">TEAMMATES</a>, <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary">Open Library</a>, and 
				<a href="https://github.com/Cadasta/cadasta-platform">Cadasta</a> to fork and clone to our machines. I finished setting up the development environment
				 for TEAMMATES yesterday. According to their README on GitHub, “TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and other
				 feedback paths of your students.” Because I have a background as an English teacher, TEAMMATES is exciting prospect. It also has a large
				 user base of hundreds of universities across the world. This effect of wide adoption from an open-source project has its origins in Linus Torvalds, the creator
				 of the Linux kernel. In Eric Raymond’s “The Cathedral and the Bazaar,” a reflection on the distinctions between closed-source software 
				(the cathedral) and open-source-software (the bazaar), Raymond argues, “…Linus’s cleverest and most consequential hack was not the construction of the 
				Linux kernel itself, but rather his invention of the Linux development model”(7). That is, Linus developed a method for contributing to Linux
				 that laid the foundation for later development projects such as TEAMMATES to flourish.
				 
            </p>
            <p>The objective of FOSS is certainly appealing. I like the idea of providing free alternatives to closed-source software. Larger companies may suffer a 
				bit from FOSS projects; however, they will adapt to the competition. The second reading titled, “Comparisons of open-source and closed-source software” 
				examines the impacts of FOSS on Microsoft. FOSS has encouraged Microsoft to diversify its product line, “developing versions of…products with basic 
				functionality that are sold at lower prices than standard versions.” Not everyone can afford to purchase several different software licenses to run 
				their small business efficiently. FOSS has provided greater access to the tools that we all need to be productive and compete in a global economy.  
			</p>

            <p>While one of the goals of FOSS is to provide alternatives to closed-source software, there are also many lessons surrounding the development of these free 
				alternatives that are outlined in Eric Raymond’s “The Cathedral and the Bazaar.” Of the first five lessons that Raymond outlines early on, I found my own 
				experience with programming a mirror of Raymond’s third lesson: “[y]ou often don’t really understand the problem until after the first time you implement 
				a solution. The second time, maybe you know enough to do it right. So if you want to get it right, be ready to start over at least once.” For example, Java 
				programming was very challenging for me. In fact, all programming has been challenging. Nevertheless, I have persevered through my education. I supplemented 
				my learning with outside resources. I took the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered through the University of Helsinki 
				for <a href="https://java-programming.mooc.fi/">Java I and Java II</a>. While this isn’t a perfect analogy for building projects or contributing to FOSS, it is something that has occurred with great frequency 
				throughout my education and programming experience.  
            </p>
            <p>Another lesson that typifies my initial experience with Java is “[o]ften, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of 
				the problem was wrong”(14). For example, I had difficulty with some of the early assignments that would require one to use loops and conditional statements to 
				create different shapes using asterisks and blank spaces. My initial design was naïve and attempted to tackle the entire problem with one fail swoop. Upon working 
				through a similar problem on the University of Helsinki’s course, I divided the problem into separate methods and found immediate success. I know that I will encounter 
				similar problems while working on our project this semester. I must be willing to create new conceptualizations as needed to solve novel problems. That is to say 
				that some problems “need to be reframed”(14). 
			</p> 
			<p>The last line of Raymond’s text was poignant for me: “It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of open source’s success will be to teach us that play
				 is the most economically efficient mode of creative work”(29). Corporations and startups have adopted the spirit of this sentiment. I noticed tricycles, nerf guns, and
				 game systems at a hackathon once. While these be viewed as infantilizing, I think that I now understand the ethos behind them. Many companies understand that creativity
				 doesn’t operate in a vacuum and are willing to offer opportunities for escape through play because it is often that second or third try that a programmer realizes that
				 the concept of the problem was wrong. These chances for epiphanic moments are optimized in an environment that provides opportunities to experience joy that comes from
				 play.

			<h5><strong>Blog Post Zero:</strong></h5>
			<h3><em>Introduction </em></h3>
            
			<p>My name is Clifton! This is my first blog post for my class, CSCI - 462 Software Engineering Practicum, at the College of Charleston. 
               Currently, I am working at MonoStereo, a record distributor. My role is data analyst and data entry specialist. I use excel to manage new 
               releases and upload data to a Magento eCommerce Platform among other things. It is a lot of fun for me because I love music. I get to see new titles before they're announced to the public!
               Nevertheless, don't ask me if your favorite artist has an upcoming release; I signed an NDA. You'll just have to wait like everyone else. :) 
            </p>
            <p>My goals for this class revolve around my desire to learn as much as possible about the software engineering process. 
               Considering that we will be working in teams, which mirrors real-word dynamics, I know that this will foster learning and hold us accountable to each other.</p>
            <p>As others have mentioned already, I too would like to work on a project that uses tools and languages that I have familiarity with. (Yes, you can end a sentence with a preposition.) 
                I know that all of us have used Python and Java, so let's try to stick with those languages. This is not to say that I do not wish to use novel tools to solve novel problems. 
            </p>
            <p>At any rate, I look forward to being paired with my team tomorrow and picking an open-source project together! </p>
