				<h5><strong>Blog Post Ten</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Meeting Charleston</em></h3>
				
				<p>As part of our experience as software engineers, Professor Bowring encouraged us to start attending MeetUps to connect with local community members and learn more about 
					technology. I chose the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/CharlestonJS/">CharlestonJS</a> MeetUp group and attended a couple of different sessions. I will be discussing 
					the latest session that I attended on NodeJS, which was held on Thursday, March 25 at 5:00PM. The NodeJS MeetUp is held monthly as a way for NodeJS users to sharpen their 
					skills and build out their toolbox. The speaker for this virtual meetup was Tom Wilson, the head of CharlestonJS. Tom is the CEO of <a href="https://hyper63.com/">Hyper63</a>, 
					an open-source services framework. He also has a <a href="https://blog.hyper63.com/intro-to-integration-testing/">blog</a> that provides tutorials on different tools 
					and technologies. 
				</p>
				<p>Coincidentally, the discussion for this week was on api testing, which mostly included integration testing. Of course, this topic has been part of our readings for the 
					past couple of weeks. Tom Wilson suggests using the <a href="https://github.com/substack/tape">tape</a> library to test, while <a href="jest">jest</a> is great for the 
					frontend. Test Server is a helper library that helps him dynamically spin up a server to isolate tests as they run so that other tests don’t interfere with that test. 
				</p>
				<p>He began with building a test, which is the first part of test-driven development. In order to test everything that needs testing, Tom imported the Tape library, testServer, 
					a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> library, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-mock">fetch-mock</a>. Fetch-mock 
					allows the code to run and injects a fake fetch that was created as a global. The tests then become more deterministic and don’t depend on other services to be running for 
					the test to run. Tom suggests running integration tests this way and then running end-to-end testing to fill in the gaps. Mock tests are helpful because the only thing 
					that can break the test is the developer’s code. The alternative to this is to sift through all other dependencies to determine what is causing the problem. This is 
					clearly very beneficial to the testing and can streamline otherwise lengthy testing. Tom suggests using Zod 3 to create a mock test and Insomnia Rest to keep track of 
					APIs. Insomnia has a great dashboard for creating tests. As compared to Postman, Insomnia is much less verbose, providing easier setup and maintenance. This is clearly 
					beneficial to developers who are typically working within a budget and on a fairly strict delivery timeline.  </p>

				<p>Github includes an automated method to test. Tom outlines all these things in his blog. Tom suggests running all tests in CI by running yarn tests, which makes automated 
				   integration tests easier than ever. He also noted that GitLab has something similar that works just as well. 
				</p>
				<p>Overall, it was great to see how testing works. While I am not familiar with all of the different testing libraries, Tom made my first real-world walkthrough of TDD very 
					palatable. My next steps are to continue learning TDD and implement my own tests for small personal projects so that I can contribute more to CO-FOSS. In fact, this is the 
					last step for me to take before I can finish a test on migrating inline JS.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Nine: Reflections on Reading</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Chapter 7</em></h3>
				
				<p>This week’s reading is from chapters seven and nine of our textbook. Chapter seven covers UI development, while chapter nine is a review of the steps taken after the 
					development of a CO-FOSS project. In a way chapter seven is also a review because I took a course last semester on UI design and development. Nevertheless, this chapter 
					is a good way for me to review the concepts of UI design through the lens of CO-FOSS. The chapter begins with a summary of the 10 principles of good UI design: 
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Task Oriented</li>
					<li>Language</li>
					<li>Simplicity</li>
					<li>Navigability</li>
					<li>Visual consistency</li>
					<li>Discoverability</li>
					<li>Data integrity</li>
					<li>Client-server integrity</li>
					<li>Security</li>
					<li>Documentation</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The next sections cover the Model View Control (MVC) pattern for implementing a UI and provides several examples that illustrate how MVC can be used. The model is the 
					“code underlying the application’s logic and underlying data;” the view is the “code presenting that component of the interface to the user, and…[t]he controller 
					[is the] code controlling the user’s input, output, and navigational functionality for that component” (209). Using this pattern helps to silo out the MVC triples 
					into components that can easily be tested and maintained. I really like that the text connects the ten principles of UI design to the MVC pattern. Design principles 
					2,3,4,5 and 6 are part of the view, while principles 7, 8, and 9 are enforced by the controller (210). 
				</p>
				<p>Next, the author examines how to create user-level security through login and password encryption. The controller that gets the POST from the view for a login, encrypts 
					the password, checks it against the stored password in the database, and logins if successful. While this is a very straight forward thing that just about every application 
					does, it’s interesting to see how easily it is implemented on the Homebase login application. In under 30 lines of code, the user can login. I think that’s just incredible. 
					I’ve done some of this in my server-side programming class, but we never did much with encryption. The Homebase application uses access levels to distribute permissions to 
					users. All of this is handled in the login view and controller code. </p>

				<p>The author continues to discuss security concerns in CO-FOSS projects by describing two types of common attacks: SQL injection attacks and cross-site scripting attacks. 
					First, “SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits a security vulnerability to corrupt or destroy information stored in a database” (219). Some ways to 
					avoid SQL injection include filtering user input to not allow single quotes. 
				</p>
				<p>Using the mysql_real_escape_string() function will filter out single quotes so that injections can be prevented. Similarly, css attacks can be filtered to validate data 
					coming in from different sources. For example, if a user is submitting a phone number, then the data should be checked that it only contains digits. Furthermore, the data 
					should be assumed to be invalid until it is checked to be be valid using a regular expression or something similar. </p>

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Eight: Reflections on Reading</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Chapter 6</em></h3>
				
				<p>This week’s reading is from chapter six of our textbook. It is a high-level view of database development through the lens of free-open-source software. The chapter is 
					broken down into four sections. The first section is on database principles, laying the foundation for the remaining sections. The author also suggests enrolling in 
					a database class; thankfully I am taking database concepts at CofC, which has definitely been a boon to my understanding this chapter. The second section covers some 
					common queries that every database administrator will use in declarative languages such as SQL; it also discusses security concerns and best practices. The third section 
					builds upon the previous chapter, covering database testing with unit and integration tests. The fourth section examines issue tracking and the need for more sophisticated 
					integration testing because issues in databases can often seep into the client view.  
				</p>
				<p>First, the database principles section provides many resources for learning SQL and combining SQL with other languages. 
				</p>
				<p>Next, the author examines sample code to illustrate using PHP with a SQL database. My server-side programming course exclusively used this combination of technologies. 
					Of course there can’t be a chapter on databases without discussing queries. The author unpacks the core queries: CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, SELECT, INSERT INTO, DELETE 
					FROM, and UPDATE. Surprisingly, CREATE DATABASE and DROP DATABASE aren’t mentioned until later in the chapter. Also, the php that is used isn’t how we used it in my 
					server-side programming class. The examples in the book use mysqli instead of using the PDO class. At any rate, this chapter is mostly review. The next subsection of 
					part two discusses normalization, another major topic in my database concepts course. Throughout this section the author unpacks the benefits of normalization without 
					getting into the weeds of first through fourth normal form. Of course, the main advantage to normalization is to avoid the following anomalies: insertion, update, and 
					deletion. I will skip ahead to a portion that was novel to me. Concurrency control provides a way for multiple users to safely query the same tables without breaking 
					things. For example, “[w]ith MyISAM, MySQLi provides table-level locking to ensure database integrity when several clients (sessions) are accessing the same table at the 
					same time. This means that whenever a particular table in a database is queried…by a particular session, that table is unavailable to all other sessions that are currently 
					querying it.” I figured something like this existed, so it’s nice to be formally introduced to MyISAM. Another option for this is InnoDB; however, it operates at row-level 
					locking as opposed to MyISAM’s table locking functionality. </p>

				<p>The third section covers database access, which includes establishing a database connection, table creation and dropping, and more generally CRUD. CRUD stands for Create, 
					Retrieve, Update, and Delete. I am familiar with each of these from previous coursework. Later on in this section, the author does cover PDOs in PHP, which serve as an 
					abstraction layerfor the database to easily map to other extension such as MySQLi, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. I knew the PDO class had advantages, but I wasn’t aware of this 
					one. I knew about its enhanced security to prevent “certain types of attacks on the database known as ‘SQL injection.’”
				</p>
				<p>The last section provides an overview of database testing. The author suggests unit testing other classes before testing the database to ensure there aren’t issues in the 
					code accessing the database layer. Testing the db layer is very straight forward. Instantiate new instances and insert them as records into the database. Boolean values 
					are then returned through assertion statements. After this is complete, integration testing can begin. The example provided seems to test the update and delete portions 
					of CRUD. The final section also covers issue tracking. As discussed in the previous chapter, clients and developers must be able to open, comment on, and close issues. 
					It is in this way that software projects can maintain the codebase and continue to improve.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Seven: Reflections on Reading</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Chapter 5</em></h3>
				
				<p>This week’s reading is from our textbook and covers Domain Class Development. There are four main sections that discuss developing domain classes, testing them, merging 
					results from tests, and integrating suggestions from the client based on their real-world use of the classes. 
				</p>
				<p>First, domain classes are defined from common vocabulary already in use by the organization. For example, most organizations need a person class or some other type of 
					general class that will include more specific instances of that class such as employee, contractor, or customer to mention a few. The most important step to remember 
					when developing domain classes is to use domain-specific vocabulary that is unique to the organization. There’s no sense in reinventing the wheel and adding the extra 
					cost of users learning a new lexicon. Furthermore, legacy code may also already contain domain classes that could be copied or extended. Do this when possible; it will 
					save loads of time.  Similarly, dividing classes between developers can also save time and provide “distribution of ownership” (139). 
				</p>
				<p>Second, testing these classes in the context of modern software development is mostly done through test-driven development (TDD), which was briefly mentioned in one of 
					my previous posts. TDD gathers information and requirements at the same time that unit tests are developed. This simultaneity of development and testing is completely 
					different than previous generations of development, which approached development and testing more linearly. That is not to suggest that we should disparage older developers; 
					rather, they should be praised for pioneering the tools that we have today. At any rate, TDD operates from a practical level as a part of the project. The author suggests 
					keeping “a separate directory of test cases…among the code directories themselves”(140). This is a simple solution that seems obvious, but it is worth being intentional 
					when working on projects that can quickly grow to a size that can outpace the ability of any one person to master all of the classes. This is why a test suite is used to 
					cover all of the classes in the project, even though not all tests will be complete or maintain 100 percent “correctness.” Because a test suite is so important, I will 
					summarize some of its aims as outlined in the text:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The test suite should have one unit test per class.</li>
					<li>Each constructor or function must be called in these tests; the result must return a Boolean value of true or false. I suppose the days of System.out.println(Insert 
						something to test here); are over. :)
					</li>
					<li>Writing</li>
					<li>The last of these goals seems a bit lofty, but the aim is to test 100% of the code and 100% of the use cases. That means that basically every line of code should be 
						tested. The book suggests that this is a weak strategy because it can miss some of the edge cases that might not be obvious. 
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>The books suggests using unittest for Python, which comes with Python. I haven’t used this before, but I think I’ll give it a try. I recently used Tkinter for the first time. 
					For those of you who are unfamiliar with Python or Tkinter, Tkinter is Python’s built in GUI. I want to build a database using Tkinter to give myself a challenge. 
					I digress. The other frameworks that are suggested in the book are JUnit for Java and PHPUnit for PHP. 
				</p>
				<p>Third, integration testing aims to test how classes interact with one another. While unit testing is focused on the smaller individual units, developers use integration to 
				   see how those smaller parts communicate with one another.   
				</p>
				<p>Lastly, the author suggests that placing the tested code into a sandbox environment for the client will enable them to work on the system without potentially breaking 
					something. In this way the developer and the client can then begin to work more closely to track issues and resolve them with help from the appropriate leads.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Six: Reflections on Readings</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Release Early and Often</em></h3>
				
				<p>This week’s reading from chapter 8 of Client-Centered Software Development covers technical writing, user documentation, and user support to consider when preparing to deploy an 
					application. This chapter is bolstered with reading from Karsten Wade’s chapters 8 & 9 titled “Explaining the Code” and “Release Early, Release Often,” respectively, which offers 
					some examples of how to properly document code in two ways: “Content written ad hoc and in the flow of working…[and c]ontent planned as a document of some size. For example, 
					writing comments is something that every developer should use. While every programming class has encouraged and even graded projects based on the use or lack of comments, 
					programming in the real world doesn’t always follow these rules when there aren’t overt incentives such as a grade to encourage writing comments. In fact, I have already 
					encountered some complex jQuery written as inline JS in Open Library that was missing comments. Although the code is short, it is still using variables and functions that 
					aren’t altogether clear in purpose. Comments are simply one of the most integral portions of the code because at the end of the day, code is written for humans; therefore, comments 
					should be written so that we can all read and understand it without wasting time trying to figure out what the code is doing. 
				</p>
				<p>The second type of writing is planned. CCSD suggests over twenty tips for technical writing. Many of these are familiar from my years spent teaching composition to elementary through 
					college students; however, it’s important to review a list like this before writing documentation to remember best practices. For example, the author suggests concise writing. 
					Short, precise sentences > longer, ambiguous sentences. That is, employ the KISS method: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Karsten Wade proposes a five-step writing process for 
					technical writing:  
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Planning</li>
					<li>Content</li>
					<li>Writing</li>
					<li>Internationalization/Localization</li>
					<li>Review</li>
				</ol>
				<p>This is essentially the writing process for any document. It is simple enough to remember and provides a visual for the writer because it follows a waterfall method. That is, as portions 
					of the process are finished from the top, each step falls closer to the final body of writing. The most significant portion of this to me is that documentation may require writing it in 
					different languages for non-native speakers to understand. I have never worked on a project of that scope, but I think that it would be rewarding to see a piece of software become so widely 
					adopted that it required teams of translators. I suppose that is another reason to keep documentation simple so that translation teams could move more quickly than they could if they were 
					translating overly sophisticated prose. In fact, some of the document translation could be automated if the writing were semantically and syntactically simplified. 
				</p>
				<p>Because the development process is iterative, user documentation is an organic piece of the software entity that grows with the application. It is paramount to an organizations success 
					for documentation to be part of the process rather than an afterthought. And so what does it actually mean to release early and release often? Of course this refers to code releases; however,
					documentation must also accompany each release. In fact, without appropriate documentation there wouldn't be a way for contributors to continue to build on each release. The lesson for this 
					week is to document, document, document.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Five: Reflections on S.O.L.I.D.</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Stupid or Solid?</em></h3>
				
				<p>In William Durand’s blog post titled “From STUPID to SOLID Code!”, STUPID code is defined as code that uses singletons, tight coupling, premature optimization, indescriptive naming, 
					and duplication. Additionally, STUPID code is untestable, which is probably the worst indiscretion from the above list. While it is good practice to read definitions and understand 
					what not to do, it helps to put these definitions into context. We’ll begin with Singletons. First, let’s get a definition out of the way. As defined by William Durand, a Singleton 
					is used everywhere. In other words, Singletons have global state. These are often referred to as globals or global variables in programming classes. 
				</p>
				<p>Toyota is a great example of what can go wrong when Singletons run amok. That is, when NASA Engineering and Safety Center filed a technical assessment report, they found 9,273 
					globally scoped variables This caused them severe issues. Specifically, the 2005 Toyota Camry software had 82% of its data objects declared within unlimited scope (33). While 
					Toyota did have a method for prioritizing tasks that are accessing the same data, this function didn’t always work as expected because the rules of implementation weren’t 
					always followed. Another reason to avoid Singletons is because naming conventions are rendered completely ambiguous and devoid of meaning. While I am not familiar with the 
					code in the 2005 Camry, I think it is safe to assume “u2g_gasram_read_u2 u1s_gasram_mirror” and “u2g_gasram_read_u2 ptg_gasram_u2db_tbl” are a bit overwrought and too similar 
					to contain much semantic value.  
				</p>
				<p>I didn’t really intend to say that much about Singletons and indescriptive naming, but reading about them reminded me of the Toyota story.   
				</p>
				<p>Currently, an issue that I want to work on for Open Library is to move all Inline JavaScript to a separate file; however, the JS is tightly coupled with other python code, which 
					makes moving it very problematic. Not only is tight coupling an issue, but the code lacks comments. As Durand suggests, “[y]ou write your code for people, not computers. They 
					don’t understand what you write anyway. Computers just understand o and 1. Programming languages are for humans.” I am not using the Open Library example to call out anyone 
					on their perceived programming deficiencies; rather, I am using it as an example of something that is prevalent in any large program. Of course, the goal is to minimize these 
					types of issues by implementing SOLID code. 
				</p> 
				<p>Believe it or not, this is not my first time hearing about SOLID code. A friend of mine who is currently working as a software engineer suggested that I look into Uncle Bob’s 
					module on Test Driven Development. The module before that one is SOLID Software Design. Unfortunately, I have not finished reading those, so this is something that I will 
					complete within the next couple of weeks.   
				</p>
				<p>SOLID code uses the following guiding principles: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and 
					Dependency Inversion Principle. The single responsibility is a self-describing term that refers to the need for classes to only have one responsibility. Open/Closed Principle
					 means that “software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.” Liskov Substitution Principle “states that objects in a program should be replaceable 
					 with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.” When extending a class, the subclass should be able to actually extend the first class 
					 without violating any setters of the parent. Interface Segregation is when programmers intentionally avoid implementing methods that aren’t used, which helps programmers avoid 
					 tight coupling. Dependency Inversion “has two key points: Abstractions should not depend upon details; Details should depend upon abstractions.” 
				</p>
				<p>This is a difficult concept to understand, which definitely reinforces my need to read through Uncle Bob’s modules. Thankfully, William Durand seems to know his audience because he 
					ends with “[e]ven if you don’t understand all these principles, always think before writing code. Take the time to understand those that you don’t understand. Honestly, writing 
					SOLID code is not that hard.” With those words of encouragement, I think I can begin to think more about avoiding tight coupling while writing my code. In this way, I’ll begin to 
					implement SOLID code.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Four:Reflections on an IEEE Article</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>What's Happening?</em></h3>
				
				<p>This week I was asked to read an article from the IEEE Software publication. IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. The authors of "Trends and Challenges 
					for Software Engineering in the Mobil Domain," featured in the Mobile Computing section of the IEEE Software publication for January-February 2021, forecast the future of mobile 
					applications. This article is a summary “of a discussion that 65 researchers and practitioners had during a panel session, The Role of Engineering and Development in Mobile Software,
					 held at the 2018 IEEE/Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Mobile Software Engineering and Systems conference in Gothenburg, Sweden”(89). They call 
					 for the academic embrace of new methodologies, frameworks, and work processes, which “are mandatory and require a direct link between research, industry, and end users”(88). While I would 
					 like to unpack each of these throughout the course of this post, I will only discuss a these with varying degrees of success.   
				</p>
				<p>The authors reveal an increase in research articles "relating to 'mobile’ or ‘Android’ has grown from 14% of all accepted papers in 2016 to 31% in 2018, a 120% increase during the 
					span of two years”(88). While this is significant, it isn’t necessarily surprising given that mobile devices currently account for 66% of time users spend consuming digital media. 
				</p>
				<p>This ubiquity implies that android developers must follow fast development cycles while balancing the tradeoffs that come with rapid development: energy efficiency, security, and 
					privacy. In fact, the authors propose that tradeoff analysis should be required “during the design and development of mobile apps”(89). Of course, tradeoff analysis is exactly 
					what it sounds like: analyzing the loss or gain from trading between a quality or aspect of design or development. In theory I would agree with this; however, it could be 
					problematic to add more to a workflow when trying to meet project deadlines. On the other hand, tradeoff analysis is already implicitly baked into design and development, so 
					asking those involved to explicitly perform tradeoff analysis might not be a stretch on team resources.  
				</p>
				<p>The authors also suggest stepping beyond Android to contribute in a more general way that won’t be made irrelevant in the case of a disruption to the mobile OS ecosystem. 
					I’m not sure that I buy that argument though. I contend that Android is here to stay, especially since it is open source. This isn’t to say that the authors don’t recommend 
					very real challenges for researchers. New distribution platforms created by researchers could disrupt the ecosystem and make entry that much easier for new projects. Expanding 
					IDEs and application programming interfaces are another suggestion. They even recommend moving beyond Java to explore languages that extend Java such as Kotlin, or a framework 
					such as React Native created by Facebook. 
				</p> 
				<p>Perhaps one of the most significant points made in this article is about the transition from research to industry. The authors warn that industry operates at scale, which requires 
					the minimizing of complexity. Often is the case that researchers solve problems without regard to complexity as long as the problem is adequately researched. This seems to be the 
					point of new frameworks, to minimize complexity by extending existing languages. The more we abstract away the complexity, perhaps the better equipped we are to solve real problems
					in the existing ecosystem of mobile computing.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Three: Experience Report</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>This Bugs Me</em></h3>
				
				<p>Exercise 6.4 of the Teaching Open Source text requires that I find the oldest bug in Open Library’s issues tracker that hasn’t been resolved. Thankfully, Open Library 
					has a long history on GitHub, so locating this was merely an act of sorting issues by oldest to newest. The oldest bug was #29, which is titled, “’add-cover’ edits in 
					Recent Changes table should display Cover as comment (for review).” This bug was opened June 29, 2011, so this particular bug is nearly a decade old. 
				</p>
				<p>From what I can glean from the comments, it looks like the goal of this bug is to add a feature to the added covers section. Open Library has people and bots uploading images daily. 
					In fact, it looks like hundreds of images are added daily. Clearly quality control becomes an issue when uploading images in such volume. The user interface lacks the ability to 
					quickly see the image quality of cover pages without clicking on each one.  In other words, librarians and those adding images would like the ability to preview the images without 
					having to click a link to the book. 
				</p>
				<p>It isn’t clear why this hasn’t been resolved yet. In fact, it’s not for a lack of engagement from the community or leads at Open Library. Just twelve days ago, Mek renamed a label 
					from Team: Front-end to frontend, which I assume is replacing deprecated language. The following day, tushar-ga requested to work on this issue. I think one way to solve this issue 
					would be to create a separate page as a gallery of images, but that’s just my initial thought. There’s probably a more elegant and less costly approach that would involve reworking 
					the existing interface. 
				</p>
				<p>Exercise 6.5 requires that I create a bug tracker account. Fortunately, Open Library uses GitHub to track there bugs and Slack to resolve issues and blockages. We were invited to the 
					Slack this week, and we were assigned to our first issue on Monday, February 01.</p> 
				<p>Exercise 6.6.1 requires that a bug be reproduced; however, we are still trying to understand the architecture and workflow. I found a recent issue with intermittent inability to 
					upload images. Our team still hasn’t been able to upload locally, so this is something that needs to wait. One example of a reproducible bug is something that I already mentioned: 
					issue #29. I don’t want to comment on a separate bug right now because we have already been assigned to an issue, which is labeled good first issue. I will post an update here once 
					I am able to upload images to reproduce our current issue #4492.</p>

				<p>Exercise 6.7.1 requires that I find five bug reports—in the case of Open Library these are issues—and to triage them according to triage rules. One such rule is to look for similar
					 bugs. I noticed that bug #29 had a similar bug, which was closed because it was basically the same thing: issue #108. I located an issue categorized as Epic, which means that it 
					 is a long-term project. This epic is for HTML validation and has seven related issues: #3881, #4438, #4439, #4440, #4441, #4472, and #4473. All have been closed except for #4438. 
					 #4438 looks to have been resolved, so I commented on the Epic to notify the lead that it can be closed and all checkboxes for the issues in this epic can be checked off. </p>
					 <h4>Update:</h4>
					 <p>This morning my team and I discovered how to upload images to replicate the issue of stretched covers in the carousele. The main problem was that we needed to open separate
						 terminals to execute the commands. I am going to upload a video tutorial that walks contributors through the process of importing test data so that others can see how to add books 
						 and editions locally.

				<h5><strong>Blog Post Two: Reflections on Two Articles</strong></h5>
				<h3><em>Reflections on Open Source in Today's World</em></h3>

				
				<p>I chose two articles to read from <a href="https://www.opensource.com">opensource.com</a> on containerization because our project, Open Library, uses Docker as the development environment.
				   While I have used Docker at a Hackathon and in a data management course, I have not used it in a large-scale development environment like the one for Open Library. I also know that Docker
				   has a large user base among the open-source community.   
				</p>
				<p>In the first <a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker">article</a> titled, “What is Docker?,” the author considers the definition of Docker, its use cases, how to set it 
					up on your machine, security features, and the big picture of containerization. First, Docker is a way to virtualize without having to create a virtual machine. In other words,
					Docker can use an existing Linux kernel on the host system to run the containers. Well, how does this work on Windows? Fortunately, WSL 2 provides a solution for Windows users. 
					VS Code even recognizes that I’m using WSL 2 to run a lightweight utility virtual machine on the Linux OS. I suppose there is a virtual machine in my case, but it isn’t the same 
					as running virtual box, which runs with more layers away from root. 
				</p>
				<p>Second, Docker is mostly used for DevOps teams to keep developers focused on writing code instead of thinking about the intricacies of compatibility issues. Third, setting up 
					Docker really couldn’t be easier now. It was once the case that Windows users needed Windows Professional, but as previously discussed, WSL 2 provides a solution to this. 
					Now Mac and Windows users are basically on a level playing field. Fourth, Docker containers “do not contain.” In Daniel Walsh’s article titled, “Are Docker containers really 
					secure?” he writes, “[f]rom a security point of view, containers are much weaker.” I am certainly not a security expert yet, but Walsh attributes this vulnerability to running 
					the services close to root instead of non-root. Lastly, containers can be placed into three separate software categories: Builder, Engine, and Orchestration. The builder is 
					the tech used to build the container. The engine is the tech to run a container, and Orchestration is the tech to manage containers.  
				</p>
				<p>Lacey Williams, who is also an English major turned tech geek, gave a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/12/python-and-containers-conference-talks">talk</a> at djangocon.us 
					in 2018 called “An Intro to Docker for Djangonauts” that unpacks the basic language surrounding Docker through the lens of Harry Potter, specifically the concept of Polyjuice 
					potion, which is a potion used to turn into someone else when the hair of that other person is put in the potion and then consumed. In this metaphor, Docker is the potion, the 
					image is the person you want to turn into, the container is you, the Dockerfile is the hair of the person you want to turn into. In the world of Harry Potter, the hair tells 
					the potion how to change into someone else, and the potion is consumed to transform into that person. 
				</p> 
				<p>Meanwhile, in the world of containerization, we use the Dockerfile to tell Docker how to build the image. We then run the project in a container. Some code that is essential to 
					every Docker container is $ docker build. Before you can build, there must be a Dockerfile. It seems that most projects that have already been established already have a Dockerfile
					 as part of the repository, which means that creating a Dockerfile is one of those steps that an open-source contributor rarely needs to do. Interestingly, each time the Dockerfile 
					 is built, it will rely on a previously cached version unless changes have been made to the Dockerfile. In that case, the cached version is loaded, then the changes and everything 
					 after the changes are built. 
				</p>
				<p>It turns out that there are a lot of things to type when using regular Docker. In other words, it can become a bit syntactically verbose, as alluded to in the previous paragraph. 
				   Thankfully, Docker has a workaround called Docker compose. Docker compose allows for naming conventions to be explicit in a docker-compose.yml file. Here you can name the 
				   containers, volume, ports for mapping locally, and dependencies such as a database that the web service container might depend on. While it is not recommended to host your 
				   database from a container because databases are stateful, not stateless, using an old version of a database in a container for production reasons is an option. In fact, Alice 
				   Goldfuss’ <a href="https://opensource.com/article/18/12/python-and-containers-conference-talks">talk</a> titled, “The Container Operator’s Manual,” she recommends that all databases be located on the cloud. 
				</p>
				<p>These articles are a good starting place for continuing my education with Open Source. My next steps with Open Library are going to be to understand the architecture and way to 
				   communicate with the database locally. In this way I will be better equiped to solve code challenges as opposed to developing within a challenging environment.

			<h5><strong>Blog Post One:</strong></5>
			<h3><em>Reflections of FOSS:</em></h3>
            
			<p>Since my last post, I was assigned to my team: Quad Squad. We generated a <a href="https://github.com/CSCI-462-01-2021/Quad-Squad/wiki/Top-Three-Choices">list</a> 
				of three free-open-source software (foss) candidates that we will begin building locally on our machines to determine our project for the semester.
				 We picked <a href="https://github.com/TEAMMATES/teammates">TEAMMATES</a>, <a href="https://github.com/internetarchive/openlibrary">Open Library</a>, and 
				<a href="https://github.com/Cadasta/cadasta-platform">Cadasta</a> to fork and clone to our machines. I finished setting up the development environment
				 for TEAMMATES yesterday. According to their README on GitHub, “TEAMMATES is a free online tool for managing peer evaluations and other
				 feedback paths of your students.” Because I have a background as an English teacher, TEAMMATES is exciting prospect. It also has a large
				 user base of hundreds of universities across the world. This effect of wide adoption from an open-source project has its origins in Linus Torvalds, the creator
				 of the Linux kernel. In Eric Raymond’s “The Cathedral and the Bazaar,” a reflection on the distinctions between closed-source software 
				(the cathedral) and open-source-software (the bazaar), Raymond argues, “…Linus’s cleverest and most consequential hack was not the construction of the 
				Linux kernel itself, but rather his invention of the Linux development model”(7). That is, Linus developed a method for contributing to Linux
				 that laid the foundation for later development projects such as TEAMMATES to flourish.
				 
            </p>
            <p>The objective of FOSS is certainly appealing. I like the idea of providing free alternatives to closed-source software. Larger companies may suffer a 
				bit from FOSS projects; however, they will adapt to the competition. The second reading titled, “Comparisons of open-source and closed-source software” 
				examines the impacts of FOSS on Microsoft. FOSS has encouraged Microsoft to diversify its product line, “developing versions of…products with basic 
				functionality that are sold at lower prices than standard versions.” Not everyone can afford to purchase several different software licenses to run 
				their small business efficiently. FOSS has provided greater access to the tools that we all need to be productive and compete in a global economy.  
			</p>

            <p>While one of the goals of FOSS is to provide alternatives to closed-source software, there are also many lessons surrounding the development of these free 
				alternatives that are outlined in Eric Raymond’s “The Cathedral and the Bazaar.” Of the first five lessons that Raymond outlines early on, I found my own 
				experience with programming a mirror of Raymond’s third lesson: “[y]ou often don’t really understand the problem until after the first time you implement 
				a solution. The second time, maybe you know enough to do it right. So if you want to get it right, be ready to start over at least once.” For example, Java 
				programming was very challenging for me. In fact, all programming has been challenging. Nevertheless, I have persevered through my education. I supplemented 
				my learning with outside resources. I took the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) offered through the University of Helsinki 
				for <a href="https://java-programming.mooc.fi/">Java I and Java II</a>. While this isn’t a perfect analogy for building projects or contributing to FOSS, it is something that has occurred with great frequency 
				throughout my education and programming experience.  
            </p>
            <p>Another lesson that typifies my initial experience with Java is “[o]ften, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of 
				the problem was wrong”(14). For example, I had difficulty with some of the early assignments that would require one to use loops and conditional statements to 
				create different shapes using asterisks and blank spaces. My initial design was naïve and attempted to tackle the entire problem with one fail swoop. Upon working 
				through a similar problem on the University of Helsinki’s course, I divided the problem into separate methods and found immediate success. I know that I will encounter 
				similar problems while working on our project this semester. I must be willing to create new conceptualizations as needed to solve novel problems. That is to say 
				that some problems “need to be reframed”(14). 
			</p> 
			<p>The last line of Raymond’s text was poignant for me: “It may well turn out that one of the most important effects of open source’s success will be to teach us that play
				 is the most economically efficient mode of creative work”(29). Corporations and startups have adopted the spirit of this sentiment. I noticed tricycles, nerf guns, and
				 game systems at a hackathon once. While these be viewed as infantilizing, I think that I now understand the ethos behind them. Many companies understand that creativity
				 doesn’t operate in a vacuum and are willing to offer opportunities for escape through play because it is often that second or third try that a programmer realizes that
				 the concept of the problem was wrong. These chances for epiphanic moments are optimized in an environment that provides opportunities to experience joy that comes from
				 play.

			<h5><strong>Blog Post Zero: Hello, world!</strong></h5>
			<h3><em>Introduction </em></h3>
            
			<p>My name is Clifton! This is my first blog post for my class, CSCI - 462 Software Engineering Practicum, at the College of Charleston. 
               Currently, I am working at MonoStereo, a record distributor. My role is data analyst and data entry specialist. I use excel to manage new 
               releases and upload data to a Magento eCommerce Platform among other things. It is a lot of fun for me because I love music. I get to see new titles before they're announced to the public!
               Nevertheless, don't ask me if your favorite artist has an upcoming release; I signed an NDA. You'll just have to wait like everyone else. :) 
            </p>
            <p>My goals for this class revolve around my desire to learn as much as possible about the software engineering process. 
               Considering that we will be working in teams, which mirrors real-word dynamics, I know that this will foster learning and hold us accountable to each other.</p>
            <p>As others have mentioned already, I too would like to work on a project that uses tools and languages that I have familiarity with. (Yes, you can end a sentence with a preposition.) 
                I know that all of us have used Python and Java, so let's try to stick with those languages. This is not to say that I do not wish to use novel tools to solve novel problems. 
            </p>
            <p>At any rate, I look forward to being paired with my team tomorrow and picking an open-source project together! </p>
